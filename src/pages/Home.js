      <p> I have been fascinated by computers since I was a young kid who spent most of my time playing games and surfing the internet. I was taken aback by how these devices could simplify complex tasks and thus as I grew older, I attempted to understand the hardware and software components that made the machines tick. I have been amongst the recognized group of students in school and my teachers throughout my school career had been very fond of me. As a result, the transition from school to college was easy, and consciously or unconsciously I had all my interests revolved around intriguing Engineering aspects.</p>
